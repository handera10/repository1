There once was a kid who lived in a big house next to the woods. He grew up exploring the forest by himself, so he knew those woods as well as he knew his own house. He would bring his friends there to play, or just walk around by himself. All he cared about was spending time where he felt the most comfortable. One day, the kid ventured out into the woods just as he had done so many times before. When it started to get dark, he decided to make his way back home. He started walking, but when he reached the clearing where he normally saw his house, there was nothing there. All he saw was more woods.
Confused and tired, he slowly walked through the clearing to the spot where his house used to rest. He searched everywhere for a clue as to what may have happened, but he found nothing. It was as if his house had never been there. As he stood there, lost and frustrated, he saw a light approach him from inside the woods. The light drew closer, and he saw that it was a badger. The badger told the kid to follow it, and with no other option, the kid followed the badger through the woods back the way he had come.
