There once was a kid who lived in a big house next to the woods. He grew up exploring the forest by himself, so he knew those woods as well as he knew his own house. He would bring his friends there to play, or just walk around by himself. All he cared about was spending time where he felt the most comfortable. One day, the kid ventured out into the woods just as he had done so many times before. When it started to get dark, he decided to make his way back home. He started walking, but when he reached the clearing where he normally saw his house, there was nothing there. All he saw was more woods.

He started to panick. "I must have taken a wrong turn" He said to himself. He started to walk back the way he came hoping that he finds the "correct" path. After taking a couple of turns, he thought for sure he got it right this time. Little did he know, he was exactly where he started. The sun had gone down completely and it was pitch black. The kid could hear the wild coyotes howling in the forest. Not knowing what he to do, he started crying. 

After a few minutes, he got up, and started looking around for a place to hide. There was an old dilipated house nearby, so he creeped inside. It was empty, so he fell asleep on the bed, waking up a few minutes later to the sound of hooves. He looked out the window, and saw his father on a carriage. He ran out, and hugged him, and they both went home to warm chicken soup. The end.
